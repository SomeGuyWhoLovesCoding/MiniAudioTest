This is a [Funkin' View](https://github.com/SomeGuyWhoLovesCoding/FNF-PeoteView) test project meant to showcase the capabilities of the new music system.

Please note it requires you to clone this [lime fork](https://github.com/SomeGuyWhoLovesCoding/lime), do haxelib dev lime [path you cloned the fork at], THEN do lime rebuild tools and lime rebuild <platform>, and for future rebuilds you just do the same lime rebuild <platform>. (Thanks to lavender for fixing the main loop fuckery)

Simply run a build.xml in the "hashlinkBuildXmls/" folder. `haxelib run hxcpp hashlinkBuildXmls/miniaudioBuild.xml` for example.
